.NET  = Ecosystem (Languages + Runtimes + Libraries)
Language = C#, F#, VisualBasic
Runtimes = Core Common Language Runtime(CLR) (which runs the code written in above langauges)
Languages = Base Class Libraries(BCL) 

BCL is built into C#

C# equivalent to Java (strongly typed, garbage collected)
F# functional langauge ?

dotnet cli - dotnet command line interface
nuget      - official .NET package manager
dotnet new ... => templates
dotnet run     => compile and run
dotnet publish => ready the code for deployment

dotnet new console --output=HelloWorld => create a new C# console app in HelloWorld folder

Program.cs is the entry point of all .NET(C#) projects

.NET supports string interpolation

String Interpolation(according to Claude) : "String interpolation is a feature in programming languages that allows you to embed expressions or variables directly within string literals, making it easier to construct strings dynamically"

strings should only be put inside "" not '' 

all statements should end with a ";" 

String Interpolation == String Concatenation ??? 

Strings in C# are immutable. So all string methods return a new string in C#

int  - 32bit(4 bytes)
long - 64bit(8 bytes)

OOPS 
(1)Encapsulation
(2)Polymorphism
(3)Inheritance
(4)Abstraction

you can't create a instance of a abstract class

In C# all classed inherit from the "Object" class
